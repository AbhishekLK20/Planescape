$ npm run start (to start the client)
```

In the second terminal

- cd server and set environment variables in config.env under ./config
- Create your mongoDB connection url, which you'll use as your MONGO_URI
- Supply the following credentials

```
#  ---  config.env  ---

NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
URI =http://localhost:3000

MONGO_URI = 

FLIGHTS_API_URL  = https://api.schiphol.nl/public-flights
FLIGHTS_APP_ID = 
FLIGHTS_APP_KEY =
